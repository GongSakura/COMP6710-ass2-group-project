### Comments 

<write your comments here>

 Best features: achieved drop, drag, rotate, and flip behaviors. implemented the snap piece to near location or back to old one if cannot drop.
 Added scale effect when drag and drop. added “dropshadow” effect, when rotate a piece, the effect will changed too.
